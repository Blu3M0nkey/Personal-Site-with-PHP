            <p>I graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Illinois in Chicago, my favorite achievement, because Math and Computers can do amazing things. See fractals for subjective proof. I am biased towards the C languages because these are the languages that I've worked the most with over the last few years. I love the control you get with C++, to be able to do exactly what you need to. Python is like a breath of fresh air when you’ve been swimming in the complexity of C++. It’s great for producing applications quickly and when you just need to give up some control for a while. </p>
            <p > Development isn’t just about what languages you know, it’s about the ability to efficiently solve a problem and bring ideas to life. While I enjoy coding, my favorite part of the development process is planning. Taking a problem or need and then finding a solution and, best of all, trying to break and improve that solution. In an overly simplistic statement, computer theory focuses more on attempting to do more for less, and knowing which algorithm is applicable to which problem to achieve this, like knowing when to use a loop and when to use recursion. </p>
            <p>Outside the digital world, I prefer to go on adventures only found in books, over analyze then research random topics that catch my interest, road trips, and excessively doodling... on everything. It may or may not be a problem.  </p>
